Objectives of the Study	
	
1.	Design a piezoelectric road generator for vehicles that generates and stores electricity.
2.	Measure the output power and voltage that a motorized vehicle can generate at different speeds.
3.	Energize low-power The electronics.
4.	Evaluate the piezoelectric roadgenerator functionality by having it assessed by professionals and relevant end-users.


## Introduction ##  

My Capstone project fom my Electrical Engineering Degree. I utilized Microsoft Excel to answer the Obective 2 and 4 of the study. I leveraged the power of Microsofct Excel fir data entry and management from the collected data; Microsoft Excel also made it easier for me to calculate Analysis of Variance: Single Factor from its add-ins to see relationships between groups from the study.  

### Excel Skills Used ###  

🧰 Data Analysis ToolPak

📊 Statistics

📉 Dashboarding  

### Speed Test Data and Analysis ###

The data collected comes from the actual test of the prototype, the data is then collected and stored in Excel for analysis. The statistical analysis done that would determine the relationship between groups is Analaysis of Variance: Single Factor, this is readiliy available after activating the data analysis from add-ins. There is no need for manual calculation to generate insights, few clicks would do using Data Analysis ToolPak from Excel.  

### Power Test Data and Analysis ###  

![Power test data and analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df8db33c-0960-43e9-b5b5-fd11fb9d2a00)  

Same process is done with this data, the difference is the scenario of the testing of the prototype. Collection and Analysis are done exactly the same with the previous data.  

### Product Evaluation Data and Analysis ###

The collected data comes from surveys using ISO/IEC 25010 survey form to ensure the quality of data being collected. Data analysis conducted for these dataset is Likert Scale Analysis, where weighted averages are calculated for each category and determine where does that weighted average fall into using range of mean. According to the results, the respondents very strongly agree with the functionality, reliability, usability, and efficiency.  

### Voltage Regulation ###  

![Voltage regulation data and analysis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e59649-905a-44f5-8d4f-fe2ebffbcd50)  

The data collected above is the full load voltage, it will be compared to the data from the speed test data to measure the percent regulation of the system. Percent regulation is the efficiency of the system after the load is connected.  

# CONCLUSION #  

The study requires heavy data analysis like ANOVA for the study to be done successfully. With Microsoft Excel, the task became lighter and more accurate with its built in analysis tools. Dashboarding makes it easier to see the correlation of each dataset and also the groups within a dataset. Microsoft Excel can do both descriptive and inferential statistics accurately and quickly.

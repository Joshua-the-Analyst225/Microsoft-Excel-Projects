## Introduction ## 
This project assesses the viability of adding Disconnect Swithches to the Electric Grid of an Electric Cooperative.
It aims to discover how much electric energy can be saved from installing disconnect switches and what case number is the most economical to the business.

### Data Used ###  
![Data Used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b3cd4e1-dd20-4397-b155-49d7fb94be50)  

Here is the available data given by the electric cooperative for the calculation and analysis. These essential data includes the the total load connected per component, frequency of power interruption, duration of power interruption, amd switching time.  

### Reliability Indices Calculation ###

This is the first step of Data Manipulation process, calculating from the available data to expand it into detailed data by Data Wrangling. This expanded data will be used for the next step of the process; the projected results.  

### Results ###

The final process of the data manipulation process; consolidating the data from Reliability Indices into a single table that can be more understandable. From this table, we can now see the projected energy loss for the different cases, energy saved, and energy saved per switch. With this results, we can now make a visualization to understand the insights better.  

## CONCLUSION ##  

Referring from the dashboard presented above, the energy loss drops as more disconnect switches are being added to the system, but how will we know which is more economical? For that, the energy saved per switch visualization can tell us which case has the most energy saved per switch. In conclusion, Case 3 should be the one considered to save the most energy with respect to the ROI for the purchased disconnect switches.

# Club Organization Record #  

## Introduction ##  
The spreadsheet included in this file was developed for my club organization during my tenure as Vice President. I proposed the creation of this workbook to provide a faster and more efficient method for monitoring our budget and expenses. It enables real-time tracking of available funds, total expenses, running balances, and projected future expenses. By having accurate, up-to-date information without the need for manual calculations, we were able to improve decision-making, respond more quickly to financial needs, and take action based on data-driven insights.

This table is a sample of more than 100 students, from 1st year students to 4th year students. This table is composed of the club shirt sizes and payment status of for each contribution type, with this, it is easier to monitor if the student has paid or not and if they are on officer who is exempted from paying. Data collection was done by each year level representative while I do the data entry to the spreadsheet to ensure reflection of payment status and actual collected payment  

### Collection Summary ###

The tables summarizes the total collection for each year level and also as a whole organization. This helped us monitor total budget for each event/category of contribution and also auto updates whenever changes are made in payment status. The total amounts are used for the next worksheet.  

### Expenses ###

The tables from this worksheet summarizes the expenses made in each event/category. The running totals helped us properly budget our available funds, with this, we can easily tell if we overspend or underspend. Extra funds are used for the next activities in the next worksheet.  

### Regional Convention Expenses ###

This worksheet help us once again monitor the available funds. Fund raising was conducted during the Regional Convention and it generated revenue for the organization. With the updated funds at hand, it can now be allocated to registration fees of each competition of the convention and also allot resources for the teams. Running balance help us monitor available funds while having expnses.  

### Turnover Data Management ###

After the Regional Convention, there is no more major activities that requires quick analysis for decision making, so I made a simpler version where an auditor can simply input an expense made and also track the remaining balance.  

# CONCLUSION #  

Microsoft Excel is reliable for accounting based operations, where i can do quick analysis for gaining insights in guiding the organization make the best decision. It made the process of calculating available budget much faster rather than just using pen and paper which they used before my proposal of the workbook. This project made it easier for us to monitor the financial health of the organization with great accuracy.

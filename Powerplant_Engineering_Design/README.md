## Introduction ##  

This hypothetical engineering project from my engineering degree, developed my data management skills in handling data and also automation for categorical calculation using Xlookup function.  

### Excel Skills Used ###  

🗂️ Data Management

🧮 Formulas and Functions (XLOOKUP & SUMIF)

📈 Charts  

### Hypothetical Data ###  

![Study area 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc6e2d04-df02-4f14-ad3a-654437eeb699)  

This is just one out of four study area data to be considered for the hypothetical study. It includes three load types and the power in consumes in volts, ampere, watts.  

### Protection Device Rating ###  

![Protection device rating](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cedf46e8-0185-4019-88d2-0b90463b35fa)  

The table shows the rating of the protection device for each block. I need to specify each rating of each block of the study area and there are four study areas. There is a lot of data needed for each protection device but we can automate this by using formulas and functions for the ratings like IF and XLOOKUP, instead of manually inputting the data, it can be automated by using a different table as reference.  

### Powerplant Size ###  

![Powerplant size](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82591913-7b77-4c6f-b7bb-b729dabdb367)  

After consolidating all the data from each study area by using different engineering formulas, the size of the powerplant can now be determined.  

### Load Curves ###  

![Daily load curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fbcbe45-43e7-49db-bc53-bbbaea6edab0)  

The hypothetical daily load curve of the study area. This represents the behaviour of the consumers of how much power they consume hourly so that the powerplants can compensate.  

![Yearly load curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e5bba81-2052-4d2c-b6a1-f7542b47d642)  

The hypotheical annual load curve of the study area. This represents he monthly power consumed by the users.  

# CONCLUSION #  
This study utilized the power of Microsoft Excel to determine the size of the powerplant and substation size from the available data from each study area. Data can easily be manipulated and consolidated to generate helpful insights. Charts and visualizations also make it easier to understand consumer behaviour and calculate the peak load and base load powerplants to produce enough power on a specific time.
